        Note the mapping logic has recently changed. See httÂ§ps://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/pull/1557

        One objective of the new logic is to never push a sample with an older timestamp than a sample that has already
        been pushed. This is not simple to achieve because sometimes a new sample will arrive (e.g. from eye B) with an
        older timestamp than a previous sample (e.g. from eye A). i.e. A0-A1-A2-B0-A3-B1-A4-B2-A5 etc.
        If we wish to combine samples from the two eyes for binocular reconstruction then we cannot push samples
        immediately upon receipt and we must maintain a buffer of samples. How to do that without incurring too much
        delay is tricky.

        The only thing we can be sure of is that a new sample from one eye will have a later timestamp than
        previous samples from that same eye.
